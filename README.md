## About
A scrolling animated website enhances user engagement by combining motion design with storytelling.  
As users scroll, text, images, and graphics animate using **AOS (Animate on Scroll)** effects and **custom parallax CSS** principles.

## Features
- Scroll-triggered **fade-in, slide, and zoom** animations
- **Parallax background** layers moving at varying speeds
- **Responsive layout** for mobile and desktop
- Custom easing, delays, and durations for smooth transitions
- Lightweight dependencies and optimized assets

## Installation
Clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scrolling-animated-website.git
cd scrolling-animated-website
```

Install dependencies (optional if you use AOS or GSAP):
```
npm install aos
```

## Usage
Add AOS to your webpage:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aos@2.3.4/dist/aos.css" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aos@2.3.4/dist/aos.js"></script>
```

Initialize in JavaScript:
```
AOS.init({
  duration: 800,
  once: true,
  mirror: false
});
```

Apply animations in HTML:
```
<section data-aos="fade-up">
  <h2>Scroll Animation Section</h2>
</section>
```

For a parallax effect:
```
.parallax {
  background-image: url('background.jpg');
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
}
```

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (including transitions and transforms)  
- JavaScript (AOS / GSAP)  

## Configuration
Adjust scroll settings in your JavaScript:
```
AOS.init({
  offset: 120,
  delay: 100,
  duration: 1000,
  easing: 'ease-in-out',
  once: true
});
```

## Customization
You can modify animations by targeting `data-aos` attributes:
```
<div data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="200" data-aos-duration="1200"></div>
```

This README format works well for scroll-based animation demos such as parallax portfolios or one-page storytelling websites, explaining setup, configuration, and code samples clearly for developers.[3][1]
